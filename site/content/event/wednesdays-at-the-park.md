Let's do summer TOGETHER!  Summers in the Pacific Northwest drip with sunshine and a distinct free and easy feel.  The only thing better than a summer day spent outside with your kiddos is to do it together with friends, both old and new.  Here at Arbor, we are invitational.  So, be sure to invite your neighbor, grab that iced coffee, and we'll see you at the park with our kids!
