Let's do a ballgame TOGETHER!  On August 17th, we are heading to the ballpark to watch the Mariners take on the Dodgers.  We'd love for you to come with us.  We need to know if you want us to save you a seat by August 1st.  We've got a whole section reserved for our Arbor fan club.  The tickets are going for $13 each.  So, whether you are a faithful follower, band wagon fanatic or fair weather fan, we want to spend the night connecting with you.
