Let's do a barbecue TOGETHER!  After church on July 8th we are gathering at Cottage Lake Park.  You can find us in the picnic shelter right next to the playground.  We'll have the hot dogs and burgers on the grill.  Please grab a side dish (last name A-M) or dessert (last name N-Z) to share.  Plan to enjoy fabulous food and your favorite friends while we all laugh and play together at the park.
