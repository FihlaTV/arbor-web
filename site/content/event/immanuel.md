Immanuel is the name given to Jesus at the time of his birth. It means GOD WITH US. And whether or not we feel it throughout this upcoming holiday season, God is still with us! Peace on earth may not have happened yet, but God's presence on earth is certainly a reality! Our hope, throughout this series and the season, is to lean into the promise of his presence.
