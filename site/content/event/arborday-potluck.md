The government is so incredibly kind to name a holiday after us! National Arbor Day is this Friday. To celebrate we're having an old fashioned **POTLUCK @ 6PM on FRIDAY, 4-28** inside the CHURCH. So bring your family and your favorite tuna miracle casserole. It'll be a night of great conversation and what always turns out to be interesting dishes. 

Here's what to bring:

Last Initial | Dish
-------------|--------------- 
A - H        | salad or sides 
I - R        | main dishes  
S - Z        | desserts
