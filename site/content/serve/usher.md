At Arbor Church we have the privilege of welcoming new people into our sanctuary every week. As the Ushering team, we engage in relational ministry to members and visitors alike. We minister in a variety of ways: by inviting others into our worship space, helping new folks find a place to sit and someone to connect with, taking the offering, and administering communion.
