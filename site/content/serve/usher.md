Ushers have the privilege of welcoming people into the sanctuary every week. They are the friendly faces who help in a variety of ways: by handing out connection cards, finding new folks a place to sit, receiving the offering, and administering communion. This opportunity to serve is available to individuals of all ages... the only requirement is that you like people.
