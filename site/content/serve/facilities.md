God has given us a gem of a building to gather in! Now we need folks who are willing to "shine the gem" with regular cleaning, pre-event prep and post-event restoration. Can you find your way around a toolbox? This team also needs some on-call handymen (or women) to take care of simple repairs, carpentry projects, and paint jobs. Thank you for helping Arbor serve its community with beauty and function.
