The Welcome Team here at Arbor Church works hard to create an environment where each person feels welcome and comfortable! As a part of this team you will make our guests feel at home, share community with your team, and play a significant role in helping people have a positive experience. If you would like to help get our guests parked, greet them into the building, or serve them coffee we would love to have you as a part of our team! We look forward to hearing from you!
