At Arbor Kids, we are about developing disciple makers.  We are intentional about creating a place for kids to have fun and feel known and loved.  From this foundation, kids will be invited into God's story through worship and eternity-minded curriculum.  All of this is done so that kids would be compelled to invite others into this same life-changing story through relationship.
