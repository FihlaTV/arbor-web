Arbor's Care Team exists to extravagantly meet needs in our community. As the hands of Jesus, we strive to identify and meet the tangible needs of those in our community, and to do it all for the glory of God. Whether delivering meals, visiting hospitals, helping with household work, or providing financial relief, we believe our highest calling is to love and serve others just as Jesus did.
