As a church, we want to be good stewards with what God has given us. One of the unique ways we do this is through the Procurement Team. This a group of people who are constantly looking to find the best deals... the free deals. From coffee to craft supplies, furnishings, event equipment... whatever random need that pops up. We're looking for resourceful people who enjoy the thrill of the hunt. We're not only in need of bargain shoppers, we also need truck owners to help run pickups!
