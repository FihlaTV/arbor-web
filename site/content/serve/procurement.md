One exciting challenge of church planting is having a teeny tiny operating budget. There are things we need for ministry to move forward - like coffee!  And craft supplies for children, janitorial supplies, furnishings, event equipment....all of these things need to be procured at the best cost possible so we can steward what funds we do have. Not just for people with the knack for finding bargains, we also need truck owners to run pickup for us!
