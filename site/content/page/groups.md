<p>Groups at Arbor are different... and that's by design.</p>
 
<p>We believe life is better together, that we were designed to live in community... all of us! That's why Groups here aren't designed just for church people. On the contrary, groups are intentionally inclusive; everyone is welcome!</p>
 
<p>So what do these groups actually look like and what do they do? Great questions! Groups are centered around various common interests and passions. Things like serving others, trying new & different foods, sports, mom's play dates, and everything in between.</p>
